# ClaudeClip for Windows (version 2)

Tap the **left Ctrl** key, type a prompt (invisibly), press **Enter**. Claude Code reads the project open in **VS Code** (or the file open in **Notepad**) and puts the result on your clipboard. Double-tap **left Ctrl** to clear the clipboard.

It lives in the system tray: no taskbar button, no window. A Windows port of [claude-in-clipboard](https://github.com/roaziy/claude-in-clipboard) for macOS.

```
Left Ctrl  →  type "add a dark mode toggle to settings"  →  Enter  →  Ctrl+V
```

## Why not Fn?

The Fn key is handled inside the keyboard's firmware, and Windows never sees it, so no app can listen for it. ClaudeClip uses a key Windows can see instead. Pick it from the tray menu → **Trigger key**:

| Key | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **Left Ctrl only** (default) | A lone tap does nothing in other apps. Ctrl+C, Ctrl+click, Ctrl+scroll and other shortcuts never trigger it. |
| **Either Ctrl** | Left or right Ctrl both work. |
| **Right Ctrl only** | Only the right Ctrl key. |
| **Right Shift** | Same idea, present on nearly every keyboard. |
| **Caps Lock** | ClaudeClip swallows the key, so it stops toggling caps while ClaudeClip is running. |

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 (x64 or ARM64)
- [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup) installed and logged in (`claude` works in a terminal)
- VS Code (the regular one, not Insiders) and/or Notepad (the classic or the Windows 11 app)

## Install

**From a release:** download `ClaudeClip.exe` (or `ClaudeClip-arm64.exe` on Windows on ARM) from [Releases](../../releases) and put it anywhere, for example `C:\Tools`. Double-click it. The exe isn't code-signed, so SmartScreen may say "Windows protected your PC": click **More info → Run anyway**.

**From source** (needs [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.22+, `winget install GoLang.Go`):

```powershell
git clone <this repo>
cd claude-in-clipboard-windows
.\build.ps1
.\build\ClaudeClip.exe
```

On macOS or Linux, `./build.sh` cross-compiles the same exe (`GOARCH=arm64 ./build.sh` for ARM).

## Setup

Nothing is required: no accessibility or folder permissions on Windows. Two optional things:

1. **Show the icon:** Windows hides new tray icons in the **^** overflow. Drag ClaudeClip out of it to keep it visible.
2. **Start with Windows:** tray menu → **Start with Windows**.

## Usage

| Do | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Tap the trigger key | Opens the invisible prompt |
| Type, then Enter | Sends it to Claude |
| Esc, tap the key again, or click elsewhere | Cancels |
| Double-tap the key | Clears the clipboard and Windows' clipboard history (Win+V). Items you pinned there stay |
| Hold the key (over 0.2 s) | Shows a preview of the clipboard under your pointer (nothing is pasted). Scroll it with the mouse wheel or trackpad (Shift+wheel scrolls sideways, except when the trigger is Right Shift). Release to hide it. Passwords copied from a password manager show as "Hidden" |

While the prompt is open, Backspace, Ctrl+Backspace (delete word) and Ctrl+V (paste, as one line) work. You can't see what you type; run `ClaudeClip.exe --show-prompt` to show the box while debugging.

The tray icon shows what's happening (hover for the status text):

| Icon | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ✨ | Ready |
| ⌨️ | Prompt open, typing |
| ⌛ | Claude is working (usually 5–20 s) |
| ✓ + sound | Code is on the clipboard |
| ⚠️ + sound | Failed. Click the icon to read the error |

Click the tray icon for the menu: status, the project and Claude account it will use, the model (**Opus (latest)** by default or **Sonnet (latest)**, both always the newest version), the trigger key, and Quit. Settings are saved in `%APPDATA%\ClaudeClip\settings.json`.

If an answer spans several files, they come as one block with a `// path/to/file` comment before each file.

## How it decides where to work

ClaudeClip looks at your open windows and uses whichever of VS Code or Notepad you used last (the frontmost of the two), even when another app such as Chrome is in front.

**VS Code**

1. Reads the title of that window, for example `index.tsx - my-app - Visual Studio Code`.
2. Matches `my-app` against the folders VS Code has opened (`%APPDATA%\Code\User\workspaceStorage`) to get the full path.
3. If nothing matches, uses the project you used most recently.

**Notepad**

1. Reads the file name from the title, for example `notes.txt - Notepad` (a leading `*` for unsaved changes is ignored).
2. Notepad's title has no folder, so ClaudeClip finds the file's folder through the shortcut Windows leaves in `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent` when you open a file from Explorer or Notepad's Open dialog. Claude then works in that folder, knows which file is open, and can read it.
3. For an unsaved document (`Untitled`), or a file Windows has no recent entry for, Claude works in an empty scratch folder (`%APPDATA%\ClaudeClip\scratch`). The tray menu says so. It then only knows what you type in the prompt.
4. In Notepad the reply is plain text to paste (not only code): a summary, an email draft, a regex, a code snippet, whatever you ask for. Ask for it in the prompt, for example `rewrite the open file as a polite email` or `fix the grammar in notes.txt`.

The tray menu shows which one it would use right now ("VS Code: my-app" or "Notepad: notes.txt").

## Privacy and safety

- Runs `claude -p` locally with your own Claude Code login. No other servers.
- Claude only gets read-only tools (`Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`). It can't edit files or run commands.
- In Notepad, Claude works in the folder of the open file, so it can read the other files next to it (for example everything on your Desktop if the file is there). It can only read, and only locally. Keep sensitive files out of that folder, or use an unsaved `Untitled` document, which runs in an empty scratch folder.
- The project's `.claude/settings.json` (including hooks) is ignored (`--setting-sources user`), so a cloned repo can't run commands on your PC.
- Chats aren't saved (`--no-session-persistence`).
- MCP servers are skipped (`--strict-mcp-config`), which roughly halves startup time.
- Your prompt is passed on stdin, never through a command line. The system prompt is passed as a file (`%APPDATA%\ClaudeClip\system-prompt.txt`).
- The keyboard hook only looks at the trigger key; typed prompt text goes into ClaudeClip's own window and nowhere else.

## Limitations

- VS Code and Notepad only, not Cursor, VS Code Insiders or other editors. Remote and WSL workspaces aren't found (only local folders).
- Notepad: the open file's folder is only known if Windows has a recent entry for it. Files opened by a path typed on a command line or dragged in may use the scratch folder instead. Only the active tab's file is used, and Claude reads the file from disk, so save first if you want it to see your latest edits.
- Two open projects with the same folder name: it picks the newer one.
- Every prompt is a fresh chat, so no follow-ups.
- The trigger key doesn't work while an app running **as administrator** has focus (Windows blocks hooks from seeing it). Run ClaudeClip as administrator too if you need that.
- Windows decides which app may take keyboard focus. If it refuses, the icon shows a warning instead of opening the prompt.
- You can't see what you type.

## Development

| File | What |
| --- | --- |
| `internal/logic/` | Pure logic (tap detection, project matching, text helpers) with unit tests: `go test ./...` runs on any OS |
| `main_windows.go` | Entry point, keyboard hook, tap and run flow |
| `prompt_windows.go`, `ghost_windows.go` | The invisible prompt window and the hold-to-preview overlay |
| `tray_windows.go`, `icons_windows.go` | Tray icon, menu, and the icons (drawn in code) |
| `editor_windows.go`, `claude_windows.go` | Finding the VS Code project or Notepad file, running Claude Code |
| `clipboard_windows.go`, `settings_windows.go`, `win32_windows.go` | Clipboard, settings and autostart, raw Win32 bindings |
| `build.ps1` / `build.sh` | Vet, test, then build `build\ClaudeClip.exe` |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Builds and publishes a release on every push to `main` |

There are no third-party dependencies: only the Go standard library and Win32 calls.

Version numbers follow the commit type: `fix:` bumps the patch (`0.0.1 → 0.0.2`), `feat:` bumps the minor (`0.1.0 → 0.2.0`).
